You are improving skill matching based on the latest `results.md`.

Rules:

- Only edit skill frontmatter descriptions in `skill/`.
- Do not modify any other files.
- Do not hardcode prompt text into descriptions. The descriptions can only match semantically, not literally.
- The score from `results.md` SHOULD affect how much you edit the descriptions.

Steps:

1. Read the evaluation results from `results.md`.
2. Surgically improve frontmatter descriptions in `skill/` based on the scores. You MUST use EDIT tool surgically.
3. You are to evaluate if the skill identified as best matching is the one we actually want to invoke, based on the descriptions.
4. Make a single improvement pass. You MUST NOT skip any.
